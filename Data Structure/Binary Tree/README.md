## ðŸŒ± What is a Binary Tree?

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most **two children**: a left child and a right child.


A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a special kind of binary tree where:
- The **left child** is less than the parent node.
- The **right child** is greater than or equal to the parent node.

This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

## âœ¨ Features

This implementation supports the following features:

| Feature                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| âœ… Insert                | Add new nodes to the tree while maintaining BST property |
| âœ… In-order Traversal     | Print nodes in sorted order |
| âœ… Pre-order Traversal    | Print nodes in root-left-right format |
| âœ… Count Leaf Nodes       | Count nodes with no children |
| âœ… Count Non-Leaf Nodes   | Count internal nodes (with at least one child) |
| âœ… Delete Node            | Remove a specific node (with 0, 1, or 2 children) |
| âœ… Remove Duplicates      | Eliminate duplicate values |
| âœ… Lower Bound Finder     | Find the smallest value greater than or equal to a given input |

## Interact via CLI â€“ choose operations:

1 x  => Insert x
2    => Display (in-order & pre-order)
3    => Count leaf nodes
4    => Count non-leaf nodes
5 y  => Delete y
6    => Remove duplicates
7 z  => Lower bound of z
