# 🕷️ Butterfly vs Spider – A Graph-Based Strategy Game

This C project simulates a game between butterflies and spiders on a user-defined graph. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between nodes and models strategic moves in a battle for survival.

**📌 Features**

+ Graph input as an adjacency matrix.


+ Validates user inputs.

+ Calculates shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.

+ Simulates spider movement toward butterflies.

+ Allows butterflies to remove edges to avoid spiders.

+ Ends when:

+ A spider catches a butterfly,

+ Butterflies isolate themselves from all spiders,

+ Or after 10 spider turns.
